## What I have done in this project:
In this project,
* I have used react-bootstrap, recharts, json data, react functions etc.
* I have also used react router to design header and navigation links
* I used useState, useEffect to call api and to show data in website, where useEffect will continuously check if any changes occurs.
* I have used custom link to show active link in header, handled some errors, made the project responsive using bootstrap.
